A toolkit for excavating compiled binaries, probably mostly for dead platforms. Currently NES-specific.

You will need to clone [famiclom](https://github.com/redline6561/famiclom/) and
[graph-utils](https://github.com/kraison/graph-utils.git) into your quicklisp/local-projects
to play with trowel until they make it into quicklisp proper.
